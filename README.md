# App Delivery (something)
To build and deliver widely used software apps today, it is expected that the app developer possesses a fundamental understanding of app development which will carry for the lifetime of its deployment. The app developer will be able to carry out and clearly explain the app’s build, deployment and behaviour. 

During the years we have learnt a lot how we best build and run apps. This include new tools to easily build and run our apps. But we also explore and implement different way to work, utilising tools and methodology such as GitOPS and Devops.

This course take the basics of app development but unlike others, incorporates our ethos of always looking forward to encourage students to look beyond the ‘basic’ tagline.



## Learning 
We learn by solving problems. We actively seek out obstacles so we can learn, develop, test and grow. 

App Delivery (something) encourages and teaches students how to critically evaluate complications, and to think outside the box in order to overcome them.  

App development is an ever changing environment, so why is app development education static? App Delivery (something) adapts to this ever changing environment. This gives students the confidence to know that their new knowledge base is not out-of-date by the time they are ready to use it. 

App Delivery (something) is delivered by subject matter experts. Those who use the tools every day and are able to give real-time expertise that can be used immediately. Delivered remotely and on-site, students’ knowledge will be assessed to ensure high standards throughout. 

## The Course


### The App 
We learn through actions. To get a full understating of what problems occur when working in an applications chain, every student will get their own app.

The student builds this app themselves when they are ready, or if preferred, they will be given one pre-built. The app is then taken through the different stages of app development during the course.

By giving the student ownership of their own app, they will be able to see first-hand, the journey of app development. We all have our own way of doing things, we understand every person is unique and their app should reflect this. 


### Docs
To work with the app delivery, documentation is an important part. It can be documentation in code but also how the app works and diffent runbooks.
The student are to during the course write docs about the app and also store all there code in public git.
This will later be a good ref for ?allying? for work. <- förstår inte denna mening.

### Tickets 
All companies today work with ticketing systems. Some have external companies that flag and work with the ticket, others have internal systems. It is thus fundamental that students are able to work comfortably in a ticketing system.

The student will be assigned a ticket with a problem, the student is then tasked to solve it. This real-world experience will encourage students when building apps, to understand all levels of the app’s implementation and further development needs. 


### Cloud Service
Cloud service is something everyone in  app delivery need to know. Most of the steps in the course will be run against cloud services and the students will have good knowledge to work with cloud providers after to course.

### We all run at different speeds
We all run at different speeds and here we want to setup the courses to match the speed of the students. The course will have a solid and easy pace that all students are able to keep up.
But if you as students quckly pass a course we will have more courses for you to att so that you can deep dive on different topics.
Say you as a student really get into coding. Then you will not only have a solid App Delivery course but you my also have passed diffrent coding courses as well.

### Courses from professional
To keep the level of the courses high we will get courses from online services. We then combine this courses into a learning path and that path will be the path for this course.

We will use course from:
- [DevSecOps Academy](https://www.devsecops-academy.com/)
- [Cloud Academy](https://cloudacademy.com/)

### Certification
Certification are a important evidence that you proven to have a certain skill.
During this course the student will be preperd to take cerification in

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Git
- AWS,GCP,Azure 
- Vault

And more

## The Stages
App Delivery (something) is broken down in three stages; Build, Deploy and Run.

In the Build stage, students will learn how to setup a local developing environment and the basics in app programming. 

In the Deploy stage, students will learn how to deploy and test their applications.

In the Run stage, students work on our applications to make them run and scale.


### Build
It all starts with code. It's here we lay a good foundation for our app and it's also where it all begins. Setting up your local environment correct will later save you time and a lot of work.

Some of the things we are to work with:
- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Programing (Python ore NodeJS)
- Web Basic (How the webb work CND/ LB and HTTP request)
- Databases and service (Mysql, MongoDB , Redis and more)
- Cloud service (Basic setup)

### Deploy (CI/CD)
Testing your app correctly underpins the structure of a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline. In this step students are to setup different pipelines and start testing their apps.

Some of the tools students will utilise:
- Build servers (Jenkins, Tekton, etc.)
- Automated tests 
- Vulnerability scanning
- Kubernetes and helm 


### Run
To design and deploy an app is the fun part, to run it to scale over a prolonged time period is where an app developer shows their worth. How often have you deleted an app because it runs badly or never updates? 

In this step the student will learn how to setup environments that can be scaled, and are secure to both user and developer. In App Delivery (something), students will learn how to monitor and troubleshot their app.

Some of the tools students will utilise:
- Terraform/Pullumi
- Imutable Infrastructure
- Observability (Logs, Metrics, Tracing)
- Load test
- Alerts
- Runbooks


## Background
During 2021 and after tuturing many students from different educations (linux, devops) I've come to see that we miss some knowledge in the students that come from [yrkesutbildning](yrkesutbildning.md) courses.

One key part that the students from this course where missing was to have their own engine. To get a problem and have the knowledge how to solve the problem and to also learn hos to solve problems.

This education is what we think is needed to train students to better start working in the app delivery space.

We that worked with this course are [team](team.md) and during 2022 we toghter with the Swedish school [tuc](tuc.md) hope to run this course.


## Call for HELP !

To make this course we need your help.

## The plan
This is our education plan right now but we are well aware that there may be better education plans.

### Students
Students and app developers; we want to hear from you. We believe we have developed a course which would lead the way in creating world-class beating apps. Developers will not only have the tools to create apps that work, but have the tools to critically evaluate their usage in the real-world.


### Educators 
Do you have something that you want to teach. This course relies on subject-matter experts. Those who work in the field, regardless of level or experience; we want to hear from you.
All teachers will be paid and compose a online course that then the students will take.


### Input from U
This course has been developed from a market need analysis. It has been developed from noticeable educational gaps. These gaps need filling, and if you want your voice to be heard, we want to hear from you.

## Supporting 
If you want to support this course, add a merge request with your logo below. We will then send you information of the course progress. 
During the course the student performance will also be tracked to monitoring that they all get the help they need. But this info will aslo be shared so we all can see the progress on the stdents
